      "assistant: In MetaGPT, agents share information through a structured communication protocol that includes a shared message pool. This pool enables agents to publish structured messages and subscribe to relevant messages based on their profiles. By utilizing this communication interface, agents can efficiently exchange directional information and public information from the environment. Additionally, agents can access past messages stored in memory to compare them with the Product Requirements Document (PRD), system design, and code files, ensuring effective information sharing and collaboration within the framework.\n"
